# Computer Graphics - COS 452
We explore graphics hardware, algorithms for generating graphics primitives (lines, circles, ...), geogeometric transformations (scaling, rotation, ...), mathematical transformations for viewing, surface rendering methods, lighting, animation, and texture mapping. This material in this course is tightly integrated with a programming component that is based on the OpenGL/WebGL API.

## General Information
* Open each assignment in the browser by opening the associated HTML file listed below. 
* Many of these projects have textures that cannot be loaded due to many browsers' CORS policy. There are a few ways around this, including hosting the projects on a website, or disabling the policy in each individual browser.



## Final Project
#### HTML File: final.html
#### Description:
* Our final project had a lot of freedom, but had to show 
* For my final project, I created a browser game where you have to catch a moving ball in a room filled with reflective objects.

## Assignment 3
#### HTML File: assignment3.html
#### Description:
* The goal of this project was to create a scene that can be walked through in first-person.
* I created a room with many rectangles, some of which move sporatically in a direction. 

## Assignment 1
#### HTML File: 1.html
#### Description:
* As our first assignment, this is a relatively simple demonstration of WebGL, involving creating circles, positioning, color gradients, and animation.
* We were instructed to reproduce the image seen in "Final Picture.jpg" using WebGL, then add animation to it. 

## Assignment 4
#### HTML File: Part 2.html
#### Description:
* The goal of this project was to introduce procedural textures into a scene with animation.

## Assignment 2
#### HTML File: cube.html
#### Description:
* The goal of this project was to create a 3D box that can be transformed by the user.
* The box can be rotated with the mouse, scaled using 's' or 'S', translated using arrow keys, rotated around Y axis using 'r' or 'R', or reset using 'B'.
